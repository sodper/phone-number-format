# Format Phone Number Excercise

Given a string input S consisting of N digits, spaces and dashes, return a formatted string with digits in groups of three separated by dashes, e.g.

```
"123-456 78 90 12" -> "123-456-789-012"
```

The formatted string may en with a group of two digits, but not with a single digit. In the single digit case, the formatted string should end with tvo 2-digit groups, i.e.

```
"12 3456-7890" -> "123-456-78-90"
```

## Assumptions

- The input S contains at least 2 digits.
- N may be an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100 000 000
